**Senior Application Security Engineer | Offensive Security Specialist**

20+ years in cybersecurity, starting in classified operations at the National Security Agency (NSA), now focused on application/API security, DevSecOps integration, and AI/ML adversarial testing.

### Core Expertise
- Manual penetration testing & red teaming (OWASP Top 10 / API Top 10, business logic abuse, deserialization RCEs, auth bypasses)
- AI/ML red teaming: prompt injection, model exposure/evasion/poisoning, guardrail bypass (MITRE ATLAS, OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST AI RMF)
- DevSecOps: CI/CD security automation, containerized labs (Docker/Kubernetes), vulnerability detection logic (SAINT signatures)
- Cloud security assessments (AWS, Azure, GCP): IAM flaws, privilege escalation, misconfigurations
- Exploit development & PoC chaining (Python, C, Perl, Bash)
- 600+ enterprise web/API pentests in regulated environments (HIPAA/HITECH transferable)

### Highlights
- Discovered & reported several zero-day vulnerabilities
- Designed 200+ production-grade vuln signatures reducing false positives
- Built automated security testing pipelines & containerized exploit validation labs
- Mentored junior engineers on secure coding, tooling, and reporting

### Currently Exploring
Hybrid/onsite/remote roles in AppSec, DevSecOps, cloud security, or AI defensive/red-team programs (Michigan-based, open to Detroit metro area)
